Description: In a competing risk setting the CIF for the first risk are
    calculated at a grid of time. For this values a stagewise boosting
    algortihm is performed, whereas the variable selection is coupled between
    time points but the estimates may differ. Consequently this allows to
    estimate time-varying effects. Addionally pointwise confidence intervals
    and confidence bands can be calculated.
